    This is Fhatuwani Mukheli, A visual artist, Who loves traveling to reconnect
    and be inspired by nature. Traveling allows him to create and gives him
    ideas and topics to look at or explore as a form of art. Some of the arts
    are inspired by the woods when traveling. The inspiration behind rather
    using a sketchpad instead of canvases was based on making it much easier,
    simple, and flexible. Fhatuwani uses his camera to capture a lot of moments
    being in nature helps him to reconnect with himself and escape to nature,
    take all those feelings, and translate it into paintings, Places with
    beautiful landscapes and best views its all that Fhatuwani needs.
